	Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be
	educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun.
	Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge
	that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of
	your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the

	This is the first version of the software. It presents a simple keyboard and a sine
	wave oscillator.
